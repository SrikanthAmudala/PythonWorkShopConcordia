"""

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array,A , of size N, each memory location has some unique index, i (where 0<=i<=N), that can be referenced as A[i] (you may also see it written as Ai).

Given an array,A , of  N integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integer

SAMPLE INPUT: 1 4 3 2
OUTPUT: 2 3 4 1
